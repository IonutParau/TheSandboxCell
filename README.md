# The Sandbox Cell

A cell machine remake focused on performance, extensability and user friendliness.

## Keybinds

Here's all the keybinds worth remembering:

* `0-9` to selection vanilla cells
* `F` to step one tick
* `R` to restore initial grid state
* `G` to show a guideline
* `Ctrl + A` to select the entire grid (useful for checking grid size, selections show their size)
* Your standard `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + X` and `Delete` (not backspace) for selections
* Middle click to select
* `, . /` to speed up time (holding Shift inverts the effect)
* `Esc` to either cancel selection, cancel pasting or go back to main menu
* `M` to skip the currently playing music
