# Graphics

Graphics settings control certain elements about how the game is rendered.

## V-Sync

Enabling this will limit the FPS to the refresh rate of the monitor you are using.

> NOTE: if you move the window on a monitor with a different refresh rate, the number wont change automatically. You can turn it off and on again to
make it accurate again.

## Fullscreen

Currently, it does not work. (issues with a library, were working on it)
